# Contributing

This repository is a community-driven project aimed at making the STEP standard (ISO 10303) easier to understand. Contributions in the form of suggestions, new information, or fixes are highly welcome.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Create an Issue
- If you find errors in the content.
- If you notice areas that lack sufficient explanation.
- To request additional features or explanations for specific APs.

### 2. Send a Pull Request
- Fixing typos.
- Improving diagrams (Mermaid.js).
- Adding new explanatory articles:
  - AP-specific explanations under `versions/`.
  - Functional comparisons under `comparison/`.
  - Implementation techniques under `implementation/`.

## Writing Guidelines
- **Keep it Simple**: Instead of quoting the standard document verbatim, summarize it so implementers can understand "what they actually need to do."
- **Use Diagrams**: We recommend using Mermaid.js to illustrate complex entity structures.
- **Internal Links**: Ensure appropriate links to related files and official documents are provided.
