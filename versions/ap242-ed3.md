# AP242 ed3 (Managed Model-based 3D Engineering - Edition 3)

AP242 ed3 (ISO 10303-242:2022) is the latest release, building upon ed2 while further strengthening the "Digital Thread."

## 1. Key Improvements
- **Electrical Harness**: Robust integration with electronic equipment design data.
- **Additive Manufacturing**: Management of process information and layering parameters specific to 3D printing.
- **MBSE (Model Based Systems Engineering)**: Integration with system models like SysML.
- **Long-Term Archiving (LOTAR)**: Expansion of archiving capabilities throughout the product lifecycle.

## 2. Implementation Notes
High compatibility with ed2 is maintained, but several new entity groups have been added:
- **Additive Manufacturing**: e.g., `PRINTED_PART_DEFINITION`.
- **Harness**: Extensions for cables, connectors, and routing information.

## 3. Compatibility
While an increasing number of CAD vendors claim ed3 support, interoperability testing for advanced electrical and AM data via CAx-IF is still ongoing.
