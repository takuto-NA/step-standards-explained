# AP242 ed3 (Managed Model-based 3D Engineering - Edition 3)

AP242 ed3 (ISO 10303-242:2022) is the latest release, building upon ed2 while further strengthening the "Digital Thread."

## 2. Capabilities
In addition to all capabilities in **[AP242 ed2](./ap242-ed2.md)** (including **[Styling and Colors](../format/styling-and-colors.md)** and PMI), ed3 adds:
- **Electrical Harness**: Robust integration with electronic equipment design data.
- **Additive Manufacturing**: Management of process information and layering parameters specific to 3D printing.
- **MBSE (Model Based Systems Engineering)**: Integration with system models like SysML.
- **Long-Term Archiving (LOTAR)**: Expansion of archiving capabilities throughout the product lifecycle.

## 2. Implementation Notes
High compatibility with ed2 is maintained, but several new entity groups have been added:
- **Additive Manufacturing**: e.g., `PRINTED_PART_DEFINITION`.
- **Harness**: Extensions for cables, connectors, and routing information.

## 3. Compatibility
While an increasing number of CAD vendors claim ed3 support, interoperability testing for advanced electrical and AM data via CAx-IF is still ongoing.

### CAE / Ansys-Oriented Notes
- For CAE exchange (Workbench/SpaceClaim/Fluent/Meshing), the practical success factor is usually **geometry robustness + units + healing/tolerance behavior + preserved attributes** (for Named Selections), not whether the file is “ed3” in name.
- If your downstream toolchain is sensitive, prefer the **highest common denominator actually supported by the receiver** (often AP242 ed2 in real deployments) and validate with a small benchmark before standardizing.
- Treat ed3 features (harness/AM/MBSE) as **additive**: they may be ignored, partially imported, or dropped entirely by CAE-oriented importers that primarily focus on geometry.
