# AP214 (Core Data for Automotive Design)

Developed to meet the requirements of the automotive industry, AP214 remains a widely used standard today.

## 1. Purpose of this AP
- Exchange of complex data in automotive design.
- Advanced support for styling (colors/layers) and assemblies.

## 2. Capabilities (Guaranteed)
- 3D B-rep geometry.
- **Color and Layer information.**
- Complex assembly structures.
- Text annotations (non-semantic).

## 3. Limitations / Not Guaranteed
- Advanced Semantic PMI (the meaning behind geometric tolerances, etc.).
- Full compatibility with the latest MBD (Model Based Definition) workflows.

## 4. Recommended Use Cases
- General mechanical design data exchange.
- Scenarios where preserving color is essential.

## 5. Key Entities
Entities related to presentation properties emphasized in automotive design:

- **PRESENTATION_LAYER_ASSIGNMENT**: Manages layer information.
- **PRESENTATION_STYLE_ASSIGNMENT**: Links styles to geometry.
- **COLOUR_RGB**: Defines colors using RGB values.
- **NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE**: Defines assembly structures.
- **STYLED_ITEM**: Applies styles to geometry in bulk.
