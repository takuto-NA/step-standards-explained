# AP242 (Managed Model-based 3D Engineering)

AP242 is the latest STEP standard that integrates AP203 and AP214, designed for modern manufacturing processes.

## 1. Purpose of this AP
- Integration of requirements from aerospace and automotive industries.
- Promotion of MBD (Model Based Definition).
- Compatibility with Long-Term Archiving (LOTAR).

## 2. Capabilities (Guaranteed)
- 3D geometric shapes (B-rep, CSG).
- Assembly structures.
- **PMI (Product Manufacturing Information)**
  - Graphical (Visual lines).
  - Semantic (Processable data).
- Tessellation (Lightweight geometry).
- Composite structures, etc.

## 3. Limitations / Not Guaranteed
- CAD-specific history (parameters).
- Highly specialized vendor-specific properties.

## 4. Common Misconceptions
- "PMI will be perfect just because I use AP242."
  - In reality, the interpretation of Semantic PMI depends on the CAD vendor's implementation (following CAx-IF recommendations).

## 5. Key Entities
Key entities to keep in mind during implementation:

- **GEOMETRIC_TOLERANCE**: Base class for position tolerances, flatness, etc.
- **SHAPE_ASPECT**: Assigns meanings like "Datum" to specific parts of geometry (faces, holes).
- **NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE (NAUO)**: Defines the hierarchical structure of an assembly.
- **DIMENSIONAL_SIZE / LOCATION**: Dimensional information accompanied by tolerances.
- **CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION**: Manages transformation matrices.
