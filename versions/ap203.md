# AP203 (Configuration Controlled Design)

AP203 is one of the oldest and most widely adopted standards within STEP.

## 1. Purpose of this AP
- Configuration management for 3D design.
- Definition of basic assembly structures.

## 2. Capabilities (Guaranteed)
- 3D geometric shapes (B-rep).
- Basic product management information (ID, Name, etc.).

## 3. Limitations / Not Guaranteed
- **Preservation of Colors and Layers** (See **[Styling and Colors](../format/styling-and-colors.md)** for more details).
- PMI (Product and Manufacturing Information).
- Tessellated geometry.

## 4. Recommended Use Cases
- Data exchange with very legacy systems.
- Scenarios where only geometry is critical.

## 5. Official Reference (HTML)
- **[AP203 ed2 MIM Reference](../reference/AP203e2_html/AP203e2.htm)**
