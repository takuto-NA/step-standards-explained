# AP203 (Configuration Controlled 3D Design)

AP203 was the first major Application Protocol of the STEP standard. It focused on the exchange of 3D design data with configuration management information.

## 1. Purpose of this AP
- Exchange of 3D mechanical design data.
- Manage design-control information (versions, approvals, person/organization).
- Provide a baseline for 3D B-rep geometry exchange.

## 2. Editions and Capabilities

The capabilities of AP203 changed significantly between its two major editions.

### Edition 1 (Legacy)
- **Geometry**: 3D B-rep (Advanced B-rep, Faceted B-rep, etc.) and Wireframe.
- **Styling**: ❌ **No support** for colors, layers, or transparency.
- **Metadata**: Basic product identification and version control.

### Edition 2 (Modern)
Published in 2011 to align with AP214, Edition 2 added significant features:
- **Styling**: ✅ **Support for Colors and Layers.**
- **PMI**: Basic support for Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T).
- **Assembly**: Improved support for assembly structures.
- **Compatibility**: Highly compatible with AP214.

## 3. Limitations
- **AP203 Edition 1**: Any color information in the CAD system will be lost when exporting to this format.
- **Interoperability**: Many older systems only support Edition 1. If colors are missing in a transfer, check if the exporter was set to "AP203" (defaults to Ed1 in some tools).

## 4. Recommended Use Cases
- Legacy data exchange where only geometry is required.
- Very old CAD systems that do not support AP214 or AP242.
- When explicitly requested by a supplier using older workflows.

## 5. Key Entities
- **PRODUCT**: The root part or assembly.
- **MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP**: The standard entity for 3D solid geometry.
- **APPLICATION_PROTOCOL_DEFINITION**: Identifies the AP version in the header (e.g., `'config_control_design'` for Ed1).
